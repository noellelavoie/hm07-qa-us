# Sprint 7 project
# This project was based on the content learned in Spint 7 Indroduction to Javascript. We had to write code for GET, PUT, POST and DELETE using the template given to us. 
# I used apiDoc and Swagger UI as my source documents.
# I used Postman to create a kit in order to delete a kit in the DELETE task. I utilized VS Code as my terminal. I used the "200 status" code as a test, and "undefined" as a test to rule out any bugs or error in my code.
